# High Level Design

The minimum functionality required is as follows:

- A rider to see the available rides.
- A rider to send a request to the ride owner, asking for ride sharing.
- A car owner or ride owner to be able to post their rides and state they are accepting riders.
- A ride owner to accept requests from riders.

The pre-requests for those functionalities are as follows:

- A user should be able to register as a rider or car owner.
- A car owner can update details about their vehicle
- A car owner can also request for rides

The trust between the car owners and the riders is based on the users

- riders can rate the car owners
- can owners can rate the riders
